# Summary

In this chapter, we moved from the abstract concept of "Embodied AI" to the concrete hardware architecture required to build it. You learned that Physical AI isn't just about running code; it's about managing a distributed system across three distinct tiers of compute.

### Key Takeaways

-   **The 3-Tier Architecture**:
    -   **Tier 1 (Workstation)**: The "Dreamer." Infinite compute, offline training, simulation (Isaac Sim).
    -   **Tier 2 (Edge/Jetson)**: The "Reflexes." Low latency, onboard inference, real-time safety.
    -   **Tier 3 (Robot)**: The "Body." Actuators and sensors that interact with physics.
-   **Sim-to-Real Gap**: The reality gap is caused by imperfect physics modeling and sensor noise. We mitigate this with Domain Randomization.
-   **Data Gravity**: High-bandwidth data (video) must be processed at the edge. Only high-level logic (commands) or low-bandwidth telemetry goes to the cloud.
-   **Network Verification**: `ping` is your first diagnostic tool. If you can't ping it, ROS 2 can't discover it.

### Exercises

To confirm your understanding, complete the following conceptual check:

1.  **Ping your Jetson from your workstation**:
    -   Find the IP address of your Jetson (`ip addr show` on the Jetson).
    -   Run `ping <jetson_ip>` from your workstation.
    -   **Success Criteria**: Latency should be &lt;10ms on a local Wi-Fi 6 network.


2.  **List 3 tasks best done in simulation vs. real hardware**:
    -   *Think about safety, cost, and speed.*
    -   **Simulation**: 1. Reinforcement Learning (millions of trials), 2. Testing crash scenarios, 3. Prototyping robot morphology.
    -   **Real Hardware**: 1. Final sensor calibration, 2. Testing battery life/thermals, 3. Verifying real-world lighting conditions.

### What's Next?

Now that we have our architecture mapped out and our devices talking, it's time to install the "nervous system" that connects them. In **Chapter 4**, we will dive into **ROS 2 (Robot Operating System)**, installing it on both your workstation and your Jetson, and writing your first production-grade nodes.
